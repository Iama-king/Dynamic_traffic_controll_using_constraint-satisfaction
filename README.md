# Dynamic_traffic_controll_using_constraint-satisfaction
In a city with multiple intersections equipped with traffic signals, the goal is to minimize traffic congestion and reduce travel time for vehicles passing through these intersections. The problem involves coordinating the timing of green, yellow, and red lights at each traffic signal to maximize the overall traffic flow while adhering to several constraints:

Traffic Volume: The traffic signal timings need to adjust dynamically based on the current traffic volume at each intersection. During peak hours, longer green light durations might be needed for major roadways.

Pedestrian Crossings: The signal synchronization should include provisions for safe and efficient pedestrian crossings, ensuring that pedestrians have adequate time to cross the road safely.
  
Emergency Vehicles: The system should be able to detect and respond to the presence of emergency vehicles, allowing them to pass through intersections with minimal delay.
  
Intersection Geometry: The physical layout of intersections, including the number of lanes and turning lanes, affects how signals should be coordinated to facilitate smooth traffic flow.
  
Public Transport Priority: If there are bus or tram routes, the signal synchronization should prioritize these vehicles to minimize delays and encourage public transportation usage.
  
Traffic Congestion Alerts: The system should be capable of adapting to unexpected traffic congestion, accidents, or road closures, dynamically adjusting signal timings to alleviate the impact.

Minimizing Travel Time: The primary objective is to minimize the total travel time for vehicles passing through the synchronized intersections, improving overall traffic efficiency.
